# kaleidoscope-rs

I want to learn about LLVM and practice Rust, so I wrote a compiler for a toy language that mostly follows the official LLVM [Kaleidoscope tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html). The compiler's output is correct for all tutorial examples, but I haven't done much further testing.

Some things to explore in the future:
- [ ] More primitive types and a static type checker
- [ ] Structs and arrays
- [ ] Heap allocated data and garbage collection
